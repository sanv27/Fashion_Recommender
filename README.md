Fashion Recommendation System

Welcome to the Fashion Recommendation System project! 
This project is aimed at building a personalized fashion recommendation system using Python, leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques.
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, which includes a comprehensive collection of fashion images.

The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code. The system processes and analyzes the dataset to understand various fashion attributes and trends.
By applying state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system extracts meaningful features from the images and uses these features to make accurate fashion recommendations.
